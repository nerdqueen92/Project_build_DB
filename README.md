# Inventory Database Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a database schema for managing inventory of mechanical parts. The schema will keep track of various aspects of each part, including manufacturer, category, location in storeroom, available inventory, and more. The project focuses on building a robust database structure with appropriate constraints to ensure data quality.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of several tables designed to organize and store information about mechanical parts. These tables may include:

- `parts`: Information about individual parts.
- `manufacturers`: Details about part manufacturers.
- `categories`: Categorization of parts.
- `locations`: Information about where parts are stored.

You can find the SQL scripts to create these tables and relationships in the project's SQL folder.

## Constraints

To ensure data quality and integrity, the project incorporates various constraints. These may include:

- Primary keys to enforce unique identification of records.
- Foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
- Check constraints to validate data within defined boundaries.
- Default values to ensure consistency.

## Usage

The Inventory Database is designed for use with inventory management applications. Users can interact with the database to input, retrieve, and manage part information. Below are the basic steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-database.git
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and create the necessary tables using the provided SQL scripts.
3. Configure your inventory management application to connect to the database.
4. Start using the application to manage your parts inventory.
